### I'm Gregor (he/him) :wave: 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

I'm a full-stack developer who is interested in work with a meaningful impact.

I was part of the core team at [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) from 2020 - 2023.

I am looking for a new role as a full-stack or front-end developer.

## Projects

This year I worked on:
- 💼 Restructuring our [company website](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) to respond to a harsh hiring climate and engage employers
- 🎓 Improving the flow of a [static 11ty site](https://fac-standard.netlify.app/) to match with the structure of the apprenticeship assessments
- 🌱 Overhauling the user interface of a full-stack application (Remix, Node, Prisma) to provide a more fluid and intuitive experience for people who are brand new to web development

## My experience

I held various roles at Founders and Coders and gained broad experience:
- 💯 Mentored over 100 software developers through training and apprenticeships
- 🕊️ Trained 30+ Product Owners through [Tech for Better](https://foundersandcoders.com/tech-for-better)
- 📜 Developed a new curriculum of projects for programme applicants
- ✔️ Led our first apprentices to pass End-point Assessment

Being empathetic and self-motivated set me apart at Founders and Coders. I am keen to refocus on my own expertise as a developer in new challenges and opportunities.
