### I'm Gregor (he/him) :wave: 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

I'm a full-stack developer who is interested in work with a meaningful impact.

I was part of the core team at [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) from 2020 - 2023.

Now, I work at the University of Greenwich.

I work on side projects and love talking about what I've learnt.
